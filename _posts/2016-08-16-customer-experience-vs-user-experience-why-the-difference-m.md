  User experience is not the same as customer experience. While most designers
  directly influence the UX, they also need to understand the larger context of
  the CX. The customer experience represents every step of the journey from when
  users are running price comparisons, to when users try the product, to when
  users may resort to customer service if their needs aren't met.
