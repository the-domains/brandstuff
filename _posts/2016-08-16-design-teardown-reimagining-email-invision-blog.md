  Ever kept track of the amount of time you spend each week reading, writing,
  and organizing email? Dealing with email is a major cognitive load-and often a
  real productivity killer. Earlier this year at Cubeit, we did a short design
  sprint-just for fun-to see if we could come up with a better way to handle
  email.
